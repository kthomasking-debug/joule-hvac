# NOTES

## Learned Facts:
- User prefers minimal auxiliary heat usage
- Heat pump is 3-ton Mitsubishi Hyper Heat
- House is 2,400 sq ft, 1980s build
- Outdoor sensor connected via Ecobee weather API
- Aux lockout is set to 35°F (from policy.json)

## Heuristics:
- Defrost cycles require no intervention unless > 40 min continuous
- Strip heat costs ~3-6x more than compressor
- User prefers "comfort-first" strategy unless strips activate
- Large setbacks (>3°F) often trigger strips during recovery

## System Behavior:
- Balance point appears to be around 30°F
- Recovery typically takes 1.5-2 hours for 2°F setback
- Aux heat activates when outdoor temp < 25°F OR temp delta > 3°F
