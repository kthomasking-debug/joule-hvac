# Archived Documentation

This folder contains documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference.

## Archive Structure

### `joule_hmi.py`
Legacy Pi HMI implementation (replaced by `pi-hmi/app.py`). Used the original waveshare_epd library with Status/Energy/3-day pages. The current HMI uses the Touch e-Paper HAT with Status/Energy/QR Code pages.

### `dev-notes/`
Development notes, analysis, and planning documents created during implementation:
- Feature implementation summaries
- Bug fix documentation
- Analysis and optimization notes
- Test results and planning

### `implementation-summaries/`
Completion summaries for major features:
- Agent consolidation
- Navigation testing
- Feature roadmaps

### `old-deployment/`
Deprecated deployment guides:
- Old Vercel deployment docs
- Legacy deployment strategies

## Why Archived?

These documents were created during active development and are no longer relevant for:
- Current users (guides updated in main docs/)
- New developers (replaced by current documentation)
- Production deployment (superseded by newer guides)
