STEP 2: FIND THE IP ADDRESS

Option A: Check Your Router (Easiest)

1. Open a web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
2. Type in the address bar: 192.168.0.1
   (If that doesn't work, try: 192.168.1.1)
3. Log in to your router
   (Check the label on your router for username/password)
4. Look for "Connected Devices" or "DHCP Clients"
5. Find "Joule Bridge" or "raspberrypi" in the list
6. Write down the IP address (looks like: 192.168.0.100)

Option B: Use the Sticker

- Look at the sticker on this device
- It has a MAC address (looks like: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF)
- In your router, find this MAC address
- Write down the IP address next to it
