BRIDGE DEBUGGING REQUIREMENTS:
- Make the smallest change that could work
- Don't claim success until you run: bash scripts/deployment/validate-bridge-health.sh and it prints JOULE_BRIDGE_OK=1
- If command output is unknown, ask for it—don't guess
- Keep changes in <file-list> only
- Check logs first: journalctl -u joule-bridge.service -n 50 --no-pager
- Verify the bridge is actually running: systemctl status joule-bridge.service
- Test endpoints manually if validation fails: curl http://localhost:3002/health
- Summarize: root cause, fix, and why the oracle proves it

ORACLE: bash scripts/deployment/validate-bridge-health.sh | grep "JOULE_BRIDGE_OK=1"
KEY BRIDGE FILES:
- prostat-bridge/server.py - Main bridge server (Python)
- pi-zero-bridge/server.js - Node.js bridge (if using Pi Zero)
- prostat-bridge/requirements.txt - Python dependencies
- prostat-bridge/*.service - SystemD service files

COMMON ISSUES:
- Bridge not running: systemctl start joule-bridge.service
- Port conflict: Check if port 3002 is in use: lsof -i :3002
- Missing dependencies: pip3 install -r prostat-bridge/requirements.txt
- Permission issues: Check service file user/group settings
- Connection refused: Firewall blocking port or wrong host/port
